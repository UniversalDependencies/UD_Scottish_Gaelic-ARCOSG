# Summary

A treebank of Scottish Gaelic based on the
[Annotated Reference Corpus Of Scottish Gaelic (ARCOSG)](https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2011).

# Introduction

The Scottish Gaelic treebank takes data from ARCOSG, the Annotated Reference Corpus of Scottish Gaelic (Lamb _et al._ 2016) with the annotation scheme based on that in the Irish UD treebank.

It contains eight subcorpora:
- 

# Syntax

We use the following additional dependency labels from the Irish treebank:

- acl:relcl for relative clauses
- case:voc for vocative particles
- csubj:cleft for cleft subjects
- csubj:cop for copular clausal subject
- mark:prt for particles
- nmod:poss for possessive pronouns
- obl:tmod for nominal temporal modifiers
- xcomp:pred for predicates of the substantive verb _bi_ 'to be'

We also add

- obl:smod for spatial temporal modifiers

# Acknowledgments

We wish to thank all of the contributors to ARCOSG and fellow Celtic language UD developers Teresa Lynn, Johannes Heinecke and Fran Tyers.
